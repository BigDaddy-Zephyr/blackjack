Blackjack is the American version of a popular global banking game known as Twenty-One. It is a comparing card game between one or more players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer. Players do not compete against each other. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. If played properly, a player can almost make the odds equal to those of the house(casino) in order to win. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:
1. Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), without a dealer blackjack,
2. Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21,
3. Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21 ("busted").
